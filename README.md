Deploying a NodeJS application (golden path)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Running the application requires the following tools to be installed in your environment:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v12.0.0 or later
- [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com)

### Running the application

Install dependencies by executing the following command:

```bash
$ yarn install
```

Bundle:

```bash
$ yarn webpack
```

Run:

```bash
$ yarn start
```

The applications's home page will be available at https://localhost:8080

### Running with Docker

Create docker image:

```bash
  docker-compose build
```

Run the application by executing the following command:

```bash
  docker-compose up
```

This will start the frontend container exposing the application's port
(set to `8080` in this template app).

In order to test if the application is up, you can visit https://localhost:8080 in your browser.
You should get a very basic home page (no styles, etc.).

## Developing

### Code style

We use [ESLint](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint)
alongside [sass-lint](https://github.com/sasstools/sass-lint)

Running the linting with auto fix:

```bash
$ yarn lint --fix
```

### Running the tests

This template app uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io//) as the test engine. You can run unit tests by executing
the following command:

```bash
$ yarn test
```

Here's how to run functional tests (the template contains just one sample test):

```bash
$ yarn test:routes
```

Running accessibility tests:

```bash
$ yarn test:a11y
```

Make sure all the paths in your application are covered by accessibility tests (see [a11y.ts](src/test/a11y/a11y.ts)).

### Security

#### CSRF prevention

[Cross-Site Request Forgery](https://github.com/pillarjs/understanding-csrf) prevention has already been
set up in this template, at the application level. However, you need to make sure that CSRF token
is present in every HTML form that requires it. For that purpose you can use the `csrfProtection` macro,
included in this template app. Your njk file would look like this:

```
{% from "macros/csrf.njk" import csrfProtection %}
...
<form ...>
  ...
    {{ csrfProtection(csrfToken) }}
  ...
</form>
...
```

### Healthcheck

The application exposes a health endpoint (https://localhost:8080/health), created with the use of
[Nodejs Healthcheck](https://github.com/hmcts/nodejs-healthcheck) library. This endpoint is defined
in [health.ts](src/main/routes/health.ts) file. Make sure you adjust it correctly in your application.
In particular, remember to replace the sample check with checks specific to your frontend app,
e.g. the ones verifying the state of each service it depends on.
